      <strong>Miyanda.org</strong> is a repository for fundamentals of public companies trading on African exchanges.
      It is aimed at shortening the data gathering and processing effort for analysts and investors so that they
      can focus on what is important to them - analysis and investing! Most company fundamentals data is disseminated
      in PDF format. PDF, while a portable format, is not good for analysis. On <strong>Miyanda.org</strong>, one can 
      screen, analyze and download fundamentals data in CSV and Spreadsheet formats for further analysis.
